# AI-Powered Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development ONLY
All development must begin with a clear, detailed specification before any code is generated. No manual coding by the user is allowed - AI generates 100% of the code based on written specifications. This ensures systematic, reproducible development practices.

### AI-Generated Code Mandate
The system must be built entirely through AI assistance with specifications as input. Human role is limited to system design and specification writing, not syntax implementation. This trains developers to think in specifications, not code.

### Incremental Phase-Based Delivery
Development must proceed through clearly defined phases with validation gates between each phase. Each phase must be completed and validated before proceeding to the next. This ensures quality and prevents scope creep.

### Production-Quality Standards
All generated code must meet production standards including proper error handling, logging, testing, and documentation. Code must be clean, maintainable, and follow best practices for the chosen technology stack.

### Free-Tier Friendly Architecture
All technology choices must be compatible with free tiers of cloud services and not require expensive infrastructure. This ensures the project remains accessible and cost-effective for development and deployment.

### Event-Driven Architecture
The application must be built using event-driven architecture patterns to enable scalability, loose coupling, and asynchronous processing. This supports the AI-powered features and real-time updates required for the todo application.

## Scope Requirements
The project must include: AI-powered task management features, cloud deployment capability, event-driven architecture, and complete specification-driven development process. The application should include task creation, categorization, prioritization, and intelligent suggestions.

## Development Constraints
- Free-tier friendly tools only
- No heavy GPU usage for AI features
- No skipping phases in development
- Each phase must pass validation
- All source code must be generated by AI from specifications

## Governance
This constitution governs all development activities for the AI-Powered Todo Application. All code generation, architectural decisions, and development practices must align with these principles. Changes to this constitution require explicit documentation and approval.

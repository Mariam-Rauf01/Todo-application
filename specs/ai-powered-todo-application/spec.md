# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Todo Application

**Feature Branch**: `ai-powered-todo-application`
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a complete AI-driven Todo (Task Management) application using Spec-Driven Development, where ALL source code is generated by AI."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Task Management (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to manage my tasks through a console application so that I can organize my work without needing a complex UI.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality that all other features build upon. It establishes the core task management capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding, updating, listing, and deleting tasks through the command line interface and delivers basic task management functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have the console application installed, **When** I run `todo add "Buy groceries"`, **Then** a new task with title "Buy groceries" and status "pending" is created and displayed.
2. **Given** I have tasks in the system, **When** I run `todo list`, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their titles, descriptions, and statuses.
3. **Given** I have a pending task, **When** I run `todo update 1 --status completed`, **Then** the task status is updated to "completed".

### User Story 2 - Web Task Management (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to manage my tasks through a web interface so that I can access my tasks from any device and have a better user experience.

**Why this priority**: This provides a more accessible and user-friendly interface compared to the console application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating, updating, listing, and deleting tasks through the web UI while authenticated as a user, delivering a complete web-based task management experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a web application deployed, **When** I visit the dashboard after logging in, **Then** I see my tasks displayed in a clean, organized interface.
2. **Given** I am logged in to the web application, **When** I click "Add Task" and fill in the form, **Then** the task is saved and appears in my task list.
3. **Given** I have tasks in my list, **When** I click the "Complete" button for a task, **Then** the task status is updated to completed and the UI reflects the change.

### User Story 3 - AI-Powered Task Management (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to interact with my tasks using natural language through an AI chatbot so that I can manage my tasks more efficiently using conversational commands.

**Why this priority**: This adds an intelligent layer that can understand natural language commands and perform task management operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by issuing natural language commands to the AI chatbot (e.g., "Create a task to call mom tomorrow") and verifying that the appropriate task management operations are performed, delivering intelligent task management capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am interacting with the AI chatbot, **When** I say "Create a task to buy milk", **Then** a new task with title "buy milk" is created in my task list.
2. **Given** I have tasks in my list, **When** I ask "What tasks do I have?", **Then** the AI chatbot responds with a list of my pending tasks.
3. **Given** I have a pending task, **When** I say "Mark the grocery task as completed", **Then** the appropriate task is updated to completed status.

### User Story 4 - Advanced Task Features (Priority: P4)

As a user, I want advanced task management features like due dates, recurring tasks, and categories so that I can better organize and prioritize my work.

**Why this priority**: This provides sophisticated task management capabilities for power users who need more than basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks with due dates, recurring patterns, and categories, and verifying that these features work correctly, delivering advanced task organization capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am using the application, **When** I create a task with a due date, **Then** the task appears in my list with the due date displayed and can trigger reminders.
2. **Given** I have recurring tasks, **When** a recurrence period ends, **Then** a new instance of the task is automatically created.
3. **Given** I have categorized tasks, **When** I filter by category, **Then** only tasks in that category are displayed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to create a task without a title?
- How does the system handle AI misinterpretation of natural language commands?
- What happens when the database is unavailable during task operations?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same task?
- What happens when an AI command references a task that doesn't exist?

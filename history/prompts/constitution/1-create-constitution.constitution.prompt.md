## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS

Project Name:
AI-Powered Todo Application — Spec-Driven Hackathon Project

Purpose:
Build a complete AI-driven Todo (Task Management) application using
Spec-Driven Development, where ALL source code is generated by AI.

The project evolves from a simple console application into a fully
cloud-deployed, AI-enabled system.

The goal is to train the developer as an AI-era system designer
who writes specifications instead of manual code.

--------------------------------------------------
Scope:
The project must be completed tegories
- Event-driven architecture

--------------------------------------------------
Core Principles:
- Spec-driven development ONLY
- NO manual coding by the user
- AI generates 100% of code
- Clean and maintainable architecture
- Incremental phase-based delivery
- Production-quality output

--------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
- Free-tier friendly tools only
- No heavy GPU usage
- No skipping phases
- Each phase must pass validation

--------------------------------------------------
Philosophy:
Humans design systems.
AI writes code.
Engineers think in specifications, not syntax.

--------------------------------------------------
End Goal:
A fully functional, cloud-deployed, AI-powered Todo application
built entirely through AI using written specifications.

## Response snapshot

Updated the constitution file with the project details for the AI-Powered Todo Application, including core principles, scope requirements, development constraints, and governance rules. The constitution now reflects the project's focus on spec-driven development, AI-generated code, and production-quality standards.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial project constitution with 6 core principles and governance structure
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific details
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with feature specification using /sp.specify
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures the project's core philosophy and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Constitution properly created with all required elements
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin feature specification process
